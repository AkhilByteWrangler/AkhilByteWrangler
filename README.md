# AkhilByteWrangler ✨

Welcome to **AkhilByteWrangler**!

## About Me

I'm **Akhil Chintalapati**, a passionate Machine Learning and Data Science enthusiast currently pursuing my Master's in Artificial Intelligence at **Duke University** 🏛️ (Class of '26). Before this, I earned my Bachelor's in Computer Science with Data Science from **Vellore Institute of Technology** 🎓. My journey so far has been about transforming data into actionable insights, building AI solutions, and making complex systems more efficient.

### What Makes Me Tick?

- **Predictive Models & Algorithms**: If it's got data, I’ll find a way to predict the future with it. 📊 Whether it’s customer lifetime value, machinery failure, or language safety in AI, I’ve built models that don’t just work—they thrive.
  
- **Big Data Ninja**: From building a scalable big data pipeline for **Hindustan Petroleum Corporation** that improved efficiency by 30% 🚀 to reducing processing time from 5 to 3 hours for 2 TB datasets, I love making the big stuff manageable.

- **AI for Good**: During my time at **Samsung R&D**, I contributed to enhancing **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, improving safety assessment performance by 15%. It’s about making AI not just smarter, but safer and more responsible! 💡

## Key Skills & Tools

Here’s my everyday toolkit:

- **Programming & Tools**: Python 🐍, C/C++, Java ☕, SQL, Git, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, and more.
  
- **Cloud & Data Science**: AWS, NoSQL/SQL databases, Data Warehousing, Cloud Computing, Tableau, and Apache Spark. 💻

- **Project Management**: Agile 🏃‍♂️, Jira, Slack, and always keeping deadlines in check with cross-functional collaboration.

- **Machine Learning & AI**: From **Predictive Modeling** and **Reinforcement Learning** to **Explainable AI** and **LLMs**, I specialize in developing models that answer tough questions and make systems smarter.

## My Projects

A few exciting things I’ve built:

- **AI-Driven Tamil Language Chatbot**: A chatbot designed to interpret Tamil Shakespearean poetry (yes, that’s a thing!) and make it accessible to wider audiences using **BERT**, **Pyserini**, and **RAG**. 📜 Increased user engagement by 40%!

- **AI-Powered Research Assistant**: Developed a research assistant with caching using **GPT-4 API** and **PyMuPDF**, reducing document review time by 30%. 🕵️‍♂️ Also cut down response time by 40%—because we all like faster answers, right?

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Built deep learning models with **RNN** and **BERT** for sentiment analysis, pushing accuracy from a 64% baseline to a solid 90%. 📈 Sentiment has never been this clear.

## Research & Publications 📚

I love diving deep into research to push the boundaries of what’s possible. Some of my recent works include:

- **Textual Alchemy**: Using **BERT** and **GAN** for generating elegant summaries (because why not combine the best of both worlds?).
- **Vehicle Loan Default Detection**: Optimized detection using synthetic balancing techniques to improve financial decision-making accuracy. 💸
- **SOAR-ML**: Pioneered machine learning methods for **oral cancer prediction**—bringing tech to healthcare. 🩺

Check out more of my publications on [IEEE](https://www.doi.org/10.1109/ic-ETITE58242.2024.10493402) and other platforms for detailed deep dives into my work.

## Certifications

Because I’m always learning, here are a few of my proud badges:

- **Google Data Analytics Professional**: Mastered data cleaning, analysis, and visualization with a focus on data engineering techniques for large-scale processing.
- **IBM AI Analyst**: Specialized training in deploying machine learning models to solve complex real-world problems.

## Fun Facts About Me 😄

- **Big Fan of Strategic Thinking**: Whether it's chess ♟️ or problem-solving, I like to think 5 moves ahead.
- **Curiosity-Driven**: From exploring the latest AI trends to reading up on ancient philosophy, I'm always curious.
- **Adaptable**: Whether it’s working on a new AI model or mastering a new tool, I thrive on learning and evolving.
